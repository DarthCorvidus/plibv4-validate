phlibv4/Validate

The core of Validate is a simple interface which is supposed to accept a string
from an untrusted source, ie CLI parameter, $_GET, config file etc. pp., whereas
"untrusted" not necessarily means "bad", but being prone to user error.
Validate is not expected to give a return value, but throw an Exception if a
value does not validate.

The idea is to use Validate within other classes instead of other solutions
such as callbacks, anonymous functions or in situ regexing.
